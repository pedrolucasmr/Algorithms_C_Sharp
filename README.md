# Algorithms_C_Sharp
So, i decided to try out some sorting algorithms and i did in C#. The idea is to explain how each one of the algorithms works and how complex in Time and Space they are. Also, later in the development, i decided to implement some Python to create charts and comparisions between the algorithms.

First of all, we have the NumberGenerator class that generates random doubles so we do not need to enter them manually into the algorithms. This static class also generate random number quantities, so the number of doubles generated are also random(although within limits). The last method gives a small array, with a fixed lenght of 11 doubles, used mainly for initial tests of the algorithms.

Now, let's talk about the algorithms. For the purpose of this mini-project, each algorithm has it's own class, all of them inheriting from a interface.
