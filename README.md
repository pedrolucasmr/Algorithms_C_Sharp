# Algorithms_C_Sharp
So, i decided to try out some algorithms and i did in C#. The idea is to explain how each one of the algorithms works and how complex in Time and Space they are.

First of all, we have the NumberGenerator class that generates random numbers(Doubles and/or Ints) so we do not need to enter them manually into the algorithms.

Here are the first type of algorithms, the sorting ones:

*SELECTION SORT*
